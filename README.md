GitHub uses Let's Encrypt, and certificates are automatically renewed if DNS is configured correctly. There is no limit to the number of certificates you can have for different domains - but each domain must have a separate DNS check, and each must be correctly specified in the repository settings.

GitHub automatically issues one TLS certificate for each domain you add to your GitHub Pages site. This means:

If you use only one domain (e.g. www.alexops.space), GitHub will get one certificate for it.

If you want both alexops.space and www.alexops.space to work, you need to configure both correctly - and GitHub will generate a certificate that covers both (via Subject Alternative Names).
